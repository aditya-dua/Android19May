            "MUMBAI: HDFC Bank CEO Aditya Puri, who has been the highest-paid Indian banker for years, has seen a small dip in overall remuneration to Rs 9.6 crore in FY18 from Rs 10 crore in FY17 despite the bank's net profit rising 20 per cent to Rs 17,487 crore.\n" +
                    "The compensation could change if the central bank approves a higher performance bonus. According to information in the bank's annual report, bonus for FY17 has not been paid out as it is pending RBI approval and therefore not disclosed. In FY17, he had received a performance bonus of Rs 92 lakh.\n" +
                    "The ratio of Puri's salary to that the median is 209:1. However, his salary has not increased in line with the 8.9 per cent average percentage increase for key managerial personnel and non-managerial staff. Puri holds around 0.13 per cent stake in the bank, which is worth about Rs 687 crore. Puri, who has led the bank for 24 years, is credited with creating the country's most valuable financial institution, which is today worth nearly Rs 5.3 lakh crore."
